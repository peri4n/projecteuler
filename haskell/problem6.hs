-- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 385
-- The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 3025
--
-- Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.
-- Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
